# Foundational Business & Monetization Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the technical steps to transform TechStack Global from a technical project into a revenue-generating affiliate business by implementing legal compliance, advanced tracking, and high-conversion UI components.

## Proposed Changes

### Legal & Compliance Infrastructure
- [NEW] `privacy-policy.html` and `terms-of-service.html` with business-appropriate legal text.
- [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/index.html), [blog.html](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/blog.html), [about.html](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/about.html), [contact.html](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/contact.html), and all posts to include the global affiliate notice snippet directly below the navigation.
- [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/index.html) footer to link to new legal pages.

### Conversion Optimization (CRO)
- [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/index.html): Replace the "Latest Intelligence" / "Recommended" sections with a high-conversion 4-column "Top Tools" comparison grid.
- [MODIFY] [script.js](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/script.js): Add `buildAffiliateLink` (UTM builder) and `trackAffiliateClick` (GA4 event) helper functions.

### Link Monetization
- Update Amazon affiliate links with `rel="sponsored"`, `target="_blank"`, and specific UTM parameters (`utm_source=techstackglobal&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=...`).

## Technical Details

### Tracking Logic
- Append `&utm_source=techstackglobal&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=top_tools_home` to Amazon links.
- GA4 event: `affiliate_click` with `product` and `location` labels.

### Styling Integration
- The `#site-affiliate-notice` will use `background: #0f1724` to match the dark theme while providing clear contrast for legal visibility.
- The "Top Tools" grid will use existing `glass-panel` and `btn-primary` classes to maintain brand consistency.

---

## Verification Plan

### Automated/Manual Checks
- **Link Audit**: Click every CTA in the "Top Tools" grid and verify the final URL contains the correct tags and UTMs.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure the disclosure notice appears on every page load across mobile and desktop.
- **Console Check**: Verify `trackAffiliateClick` doesn't throw errors when Google Analytics is not yet fully initialized on the user's end (graceful degradation).
