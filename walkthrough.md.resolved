# Walkthrough: Mobile & Performance Optimization

All requested mobile refinements and performance optimizations have been implemented on the `mobile-refinement` branch. The site now provides a "flawless" mobile experience with a functional hamburger menu and stable desktop layout.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Mobile Hamburger Navigation
- **CSS-Based Layout**: Implemented a modern sidebar overlay that slides in from the right.
- **Minimal JavaScript Toggle**: Added lightweight logic in [script.js](file:///c:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/script.js) to handle opening/closing the menu and icon transitions (bars to close).
- **Auto-Close**: The menu automatically closes when a navigation link is clicked or when the user scrolls significantly.

### 2. Responsive Layout Refinements
- **375px / 414px (Mobile)**: Optimized typography and spacing. Hero sections are now centered with full-width CTAs for better thumb-reach.
- **768px (Tablet)**: Adjusted container widths and grid layouts to ensure content remains readable without excessive white space.
- **1280px (Desktop)**: Verified that the desktop experience remains stable and unchanged, preserving the high-end glassmorphic aesthetic.

### 3. Performance & Stability
- **Lazy Loading**: Verified `loading="lazy"` on all below-the-fold product images in post reviews to improve initial page load speed.
- **CSS Cleanup**: Removed redundant mobile navigation rules and unified spacing variables.
- **Site-Wide Sync**: Updated [sync_nav.py](file:///C:/Users/PMLS/Desktop/Youtube%20Shorts/b2b_blog/sync_nav.py) and synchronized the new navigation structure across all 20+ pages.
