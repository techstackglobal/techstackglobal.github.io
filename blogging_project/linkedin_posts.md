## Post 1: The Revenue Blueprint (Authority)
**Hook:** Most people are chasing $10 commissions in B2C. We are chasing $1,200 commissions in B2B. There is a difference.

**Body:** 
The 2026 tech stack isn't about "doing more." It's about automating the right things. 

I’ve just published the full blueprint on how we are scaling revenue to $10k/mo using high-ticket automation and elite B2B partnerships.

## Post 2: The E-commerce Verdict (Expertise)
**Hook:** Shopify or BigCommerce? The choice isn't technical. It's financial.

**Body:** 
Most founders choose their platform based on a "feeling" or a 14-day trial. 
In 2026, enterprise scaling requires looking at:
- API limits (for automation)
- Transaction fee curves
- Integration depth for AI agents

We just dropped the 2026 Enterprise Verdict. Don't build on the wrong foundation.

## Post 3: The 'Solopreneur' Myth (Controversial)
**Hook:** The 'Solopreneur' is dead. The 'Orchestrator' is the new winner.

**Body:** 
Trying to do everything yourself is the fastest way to stay small.
Smart founders in 2026 are using "Vetted" talent to build their automation engines while they focus on high-level strategy.
