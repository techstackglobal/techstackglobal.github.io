# Contributing Guidelines

## Foundation Files & Structural Changes

**Critical Safety Directive:** No automated bulk edits on product review files. 
Changes to individual posts (`posts/*.html`) and the review template (`posts/template.html`) must be performed cautiously and manually, or via carefully scoped scripts restricted to a feature branch.

### Change Process
1. Do not deploy structural UI changes directly to `main`.
2. Create a feature branch named `fix/<short-description>-<date>` or `feat/<short-description>-<date>`.
3. Changes to `posts/*` must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR) with preview links.
4. The PR must receive owner sign-off before merging into `main`.

Please refer to the emergency standardization pipeline for compliance requirements.
